## Projects

I have participated in these projects:

* **STM32 OTA Bootloader** - written in ANSI-C, this bootloader downloads, flashes and verifies the latest firmware to the STM32F103x FLASH partition automatically.

* **Hong Kong Toilet Finder** - an Android App which locates itself and finds the nearest public toilet in Hong Kong using Google APIs [[Code](https://github.com/cmcvista/HKToilet)].

* **Boxing Machine iOS Client** - written in Swift 4, this is an iOS App which uses WebSocket and JSON to control a boxing machine connected to a local network.
